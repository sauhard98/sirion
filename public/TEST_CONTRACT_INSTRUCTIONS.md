# Sirion Test Contract

Please add a file named `sirion-test-contract.pdf` to the `/public` folder.

This test contract should be a sample contract PDF that will be used for testing the application with cached responses.

When a user uploads a file with the exact name "sirion-test-contract.pdf", the application will return pre-configured mock data instantly without calling the Gemini API, allowing for quick testing and demonstration.
